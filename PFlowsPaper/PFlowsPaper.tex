\section{Introduction}
Phosphorus is an essential for production of food which has been intensively used for crop and livestock production since the development of synthetic fertilizers in the XIX and XX centuries \citep{Kausar19}. The combination of synthetic fertilizers with other modern intensive agricultural techniques have increased the productivity of agriculture and farming industries \citep{pingali2012green}.
However, the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture has resulted in the over-application of phosphorus in many regions worldwide REF, while the run of intensive livestock production facilities, also known as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) \citep{animal_unit_definition}, result in important difficulties in the management of the large amounts of manure produced, which is often spread in lands in the vicinity of CAFOs, which also leads to the accumulation of phosphorus in soil. Soil acts as a phosphorus reservoir \citep{ehlert2003potential}, building-up a legacy P that can be used for future crops, but also can be transported to waterbodies by erosion and runoff leading to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.

The dual dimension of the anthropogenic use of phosphorus, i.e., its key role in the food production system and the negative environmental impacts associated with the phosphorus used in intensive agricultural techniques, has been stated by the United Nations Environment Assembly in the resolution UNEP/EA.5/Res.2 \citep{UN_Phosphorus}. An additional factor to be considered for addressing the phosphorus challenge is the non-renewable nature of phosphorus, since the phosphorus consumed is not replenished by natural means at human time scale, and there is currently no known synthetic substitute for this material \citep{cordell2009story}. Since the global phosphorus reserves are concentrated in a few number of regions, the supply of phosphorus from a limited number of global supply chains lacks resiliency and it has been proven that it can be globally disrupted by regional events and conflicts, resulting geopolitical tensions \citep{FAO_UkraineWar}. As a consequence, the recovery and recycling of phosphorus is not just a desirable but also a necessary approach to assure a sustainable, reliable, and sovereign food production system. 

Although the main uses of phosphorus are in the agri-food sector, phosphorus is also involved in other industrial activities, including steel, chemical, and forestry industries. Henceforth, phosphorus is a key material for many aspects of human development. As a result, mapping the phosphorus flows involved in human activities to detect opportunities for recovery and recycling is essential for, in a second stage, assess amount of phosphorus that is viable to recover, the economical costs involved, and the enhancement in terms of resiliency of the regional food production system, savings from the reduction of phosphorus imports, and the mitigation of phosphorus pollution on the region implementing strategies for phosphorus recovery and recycling. The quantification of phosphorus flows has been addressed in previous works in the literature for certain sectors such as the agri-food sector \citep{boh2020nitrogen, zhou2021model, nesme2018global}. Additionally, studies on the global phosphorus flows have also been performed \citep{villalba2008global, chen2016half}, although these studies tend to have a low flow resolution since these are aggregated by major sectors. Additionally, the works quantifying phosphorus often include qualitative recommendations to improve the phosphorus use efficiency and recycling \citep{van2016phosphorus, senthilkumar2012conceptual}, but often they do not include quantitivae assessments on the amount of phopshorus which recovery is feasible along with the costs involved. Conversely, those works focused on estimating the recoverable phosphorus and the associated recovery cost target specific flows, lacking a holistic perspective of the phosphorus flows in the various human activities \citep{martin2021geospatial, sampat2018technologies}.

In this work, we have selected the Canadian province of Ontario for mapping the phosphorus flows involved in the agri-food, industrial and urban sectors. This data is used to assess the amount of phosphorus that could be recovered within the province, considering different scenarios regarding the availability of phosphorus recovery technologies, and to estimate the costs associated with the recovery of phosphorus. Finally, we discuss the implications on the use of phosphorus in Ontario that would be derived from implementing active phosphorus recovery and recycling approaches.

\section{Methods}
%\subsection{Scope}
%We seek to quantify the phosphorus flows used in human activities, including the agricultural, urban, and industrial sectors. 

%The assessment is performed dividing the target sector in two subsectors, i.e., livestock and crop production, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Scope}. These subsectors are in turn sub-divided into specific activities, such as animal feeding, manure production, fertilizer application, etc.

\subsection{Spatial resolution}
%The study is carried out at Census Division level \citep{CensusDivisionCD}. The database collecting the IDs of Ontario Census Divisions, their names, and geospatial information is taken from \citet{CensusDivisionOpendatasoft}.

\subsection{Temporal resolution}
%The study has being performed for years 2001-2021. However, for the years 2001-2006 and 2020-2021 there are some unavailable data, resulting in a partial loose resolution of the study. Therefore, the most complete information on agricultural P flows is reported for the years 2007-2019.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:FigFlowsSummary} summarizes the phosphorus flows in the province of Ontario. It can be observed that the flow of of phosphorus through the anthropogenic activities are divided into 3 independent networks, i.e., the flow of phosphorus involved the production and processing of food (including the treatment of wastewater), the flow of phosphorus used in the steel and chemical industries, and the phosphorus involved in the forestry industry.

The production of animal food products exhibits a lower phosphorus use efficiency than the production of plant base products, similarly to the use effciciency of other resources such as water CITE HERE, CALCULAR ENTRA VS SALE!

\section{Conclusions}

%\section{Livestock sector}
%Phosphorus flows in the livestock sector can be defined taking the animal as reference, i,e., P inputs in the form of animal feeding, and P outputs, which include manure, milk, eggs, meat, and carcasses, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:LivestockPFlows}.

%\subsection{Livestock census} \label{section:LivestockCensus}
%Livestock census is retrieved from the Census of Agriculture performed by Statistics Canada -- Statistique Canada every five years, i.e, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016, for cattle \citep{LivestockCensusCattle}, sheep \citep{LivestockCensusSheep}, swine \citep{LivestockCensusPig}, poultry \citep{LivestockCensusPoultry}, and other livestock \citep{LivestockCensusOtherLivestock}. The inventory of rabbits is not available prior 2009.
%
%Livestock census is reported using Dissemination Geography Unique Identifiers (DGUIDs). These identifiers are built based on 4 items combined in a unique DGUID identifier: vintage (4 digits representing the year of data collection), the type of geographic areas covered by the dataset (1 character code, A or S denoting administrative or statistical areas respectively), the schema (4 digits item denoting the kind of division considered. 0003 denotes Census Division), and the Geographic Unique Identifier (GEOUID) (variable alphanumeric code assigned to each individual geographical division), which in this case corresponds with the Census Divisions of Ontario identifier (a 4 digits code starting by `35') \citep{DGUID}. The GEOUID is extracted from the DGUID reported by the census using Pandas \citep{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010} to retrieve the number of animals of each type in each Census Division.
%
%\textcolor{red}{The inventory of animals for the years between two consecutive Census of Agriculture has been estimated through a linear interpolation between the data of consecutive census.}
%
%\subsection{Correction by animal production cycles} \label{section:CorrectionProductionCycles}
%The livestock census provides a snapshot of the number of animals in the region studied. We assumed that the number of animals reported is maintained constant along the year (i.e., the animals culled are replaces by new ones). However, in the case of broiler and turkey the number of animals reported by the livestock census have been reduced by a factor of 0.68 and 0.80 respectively, since these animals have life cycles of 43 and 80 days respectively, maintaining the barns empty for 20 days between cycles, as reported by \citet{yang2007development}.
%
%\subsection{P flows in manure}
%\subsubsection{Manure generation}
%Each type of animal has been in turn classified in different groups attending its different life stages as listed below. Moreover, a number of assumptions have been considered for the animal under evaluation to estimate the P released in the form of manure, which are listed below. The manure produced by elk, deer, and wild boar farming could not be accounted due to the lack of data regarding manure generation.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{Cattle:} Dairy cows, beef cows, beef calves, and dairy heifers are differentiated based on the data on manure generation and composition available.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Bulls and steers have been considered comparable to beef cows.
%		\item Calves have been considered beef calves.
%		\item Due to the lack of data for beef heifers and dairy heifers are merged as dairy heifers.
%	\end{itemize}
%	
%	\item \textbf{Swine:} Mature and immature animals are differentiated based on the data on manure generation and composition available.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Grower and finishing pigs, nursing pigs, and weaner pigs have been considered as immature pigs.
%		\item Sows and gilts for breeding, and boars have been considered as mature pigs.
%	\end{itemize}
%	
%	\item \textbf{Sheep:} Sheep and lambs are differentiated based on the data on manure generation and composition available. 
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Ewes and rams have been considered as sheep.
%	\end{itemize}
%	
%	\item \textbf{Poultry:} Chicken broilers and pullets, laying hens, and turkeys are differentiated based on the data on manure generation and composition available. 
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Broilers, roasters, cornish. and other poultry have been considered comparable to chicken broilers.
%		\item Layer and broiler breeders (pullets and hens), and pullets under 19 weeks, intended for laying table eggs, are considered chicken pullets.
%		\item Laying hens, 19 weeks and over, that produce table eggs are considered chicken layers.
%	\end{itemize}
%
%		\item \textbf{Horses:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, all horses are considered as a single animal type. 
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Horses and ponies are all considered horses.
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{Goats:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, all goats are considered as a single animal type. 
%	\item \textbf{Rabbit:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, all rabbits are considered as a single animal type. 
%	\item \textbf{Mink:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, all minks are considered as a single animal type. 
%	\item \textbf{Bison:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, all bison are considered as a single animal type. 
%	\item \textbf{Llamas and alpacas:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, llamas and alpacas could be evaluated separately. However, the data reported by the livestock census aggregate these type of animals \citep{LivestockCensusOtherLivestock}.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item The average values for manure generation and composition of llamas and alpacas have been considered.
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%Manure production in each Census Division is estimated for each type of animal under consideration combining the number of animals $\left(N_{animals} \right) $ reported by the livestock census and the manure production rate of each type of animal $\left(m \right) $, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:ManureProd}.
%%reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture \citep{USDAHandbook, Kellog2010}.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& Manure \left( \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{day}} \right)  = N_{animals_{i}} \left(\text{animals} \right) \cdot AU_{eq_{i}} \left( \frac{\text{AU}}{\text{animals}} \right) \cdot m_{i} \left( \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{day} \cdot \text{AU}}\right) \label{eq:ManureProd}  \\
%	& \forall \ i \ \in \big\{\text{Beef Cow, Dairy Cow, Beef Calf, Dairy Heifer, Swine Mature, Swine Inmature,} \nonumber \\
%	& \text{Sheep, Lamb, Broiler, Pullet, Chicke Layer, Turkey, Horse, Goat, Rabbit, Mink,} \nonumber \\
%	& \text{Bison,Llamas/Alpacas}\big\} \nonumber 
%\end{align}
%
%\subsubsection{P releases}
%The amount of P contained in manure is calculated based on the composition reported for each type of manure, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:PProd} \citep{USDAHandbook, Kellog2010, vallentine1990grazing, pagliari2012investigation, barnett1994phosphorus, BrownCompositions, NetherlandsCompositions, NSCompositions,
%%abdoli2014feasibility, 
%NERCCompositions}. These values are collected in Table \ref{table:waste}.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{manure} \left( \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{day}} \right)  = Manure \left( \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{day}} \right) \cdot P_{total} \left(\%\text{wt}\right) \label{eq:PProd}

%The production of milk in Ontario has been retrieved at county level from the statistical data reported by \citet{MilkOntario}. These data is available for the years 2007 to 2020. However, not all counties directly align with Census Division, and the data of some counties have been merged or broken down in order to obtain the data for the corresponding Census Divisions. In those cases where county data have been broken down into several Census Divisions, this procedure has been performed proportionally to the number of dairy cows in the targeted Census Division over the total number of dairy cows in the original county. The number of cows at Census Division level is obtained from \citet{LivestockCensusCattle}, see section \ref{section:LivestockCensus} for more details.

%\subsubsection{P flows in eggs}
%The production of eggs in Ontario has been retrieved at province level from \citet{EggOntario}. These data is available for the years 1998 to 2019. The data at provincial level is broken down at census level proportionally to the number of layer chickens in them reported by the Census of Agriculture \citep{LivestockCensusPoultry}, see section \ref{section:LivestockCensus} for more details.
%
%Since the egg is composed by white, yolk, and shield, all these elements must be accounted to compute the phosphorus contained in eggs. Since there is not a clear consensus in the literature regarding the phosphorus content of eggs, an average value of $173.35 \ \sfrac{\text{mg}}{100\text{g\textsubscript{egg}}}$ is assumed based on different works \citep{matt2009effect, rehault2019golden, bologa2013research}.

%\subsubsection{P flows in slaughter products} \label{section:PSlaughterProducts}
%Slaugthering facilities are part of the meat processing plants of Ontario. The data on slaugthering facilities in Ontario are retrieved from licensing permits reported by the goverment. However, it must be noted that meat plants licensing can be either federal or provincial \citep{RegulationMeatPlants}. Therefore, data from both kind of facilities must be accounted.
%%which data are separately reported. The deadstocks are reported at provicial level for both types of slaughtering plants. 
%
%\paragraph{Cattle} The number of cattle slaughtered in federal and provincial facilities in the province of Ontario is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected (Annual)' and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected (Annual)' sections respectively.
%
%\paragraph{Calves} The number of calves slaughtered in federal and provincial facilities in the province of Ontario is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected (Annual)' and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected (Annual)' sections respectively.
%
%\paragraph{Pigs} The number of total hogs slaughtered in Ontario (including both federally and provincially licensed facilities) is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat} by combining the 'Origin of hogs slaughtered – federally and provincially inspected', 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected (Annual)', and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected (Annual)' sections.
%
%\paragraph{Sheep and lambs} The number of sheep and lambs slaughtered in federally and Ontario (provincially) licensed plants is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected' and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected' sections respectively. However, for federally inspected facilities the data reported is aggregated for Ontario and the western provinces. The number of sheep and lambs slaughtered in federally inspected facilities is estimated from the ratio of animals culled in provincially licensed plants in Ontario to those in the western provinces for each year under evaluation.  
%
%\paragraph{Goats} The number of sheep and lambs slaughtered in federally and provincially licensed plants is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Goats – federally and provincially inspected' section. Only data since 2014 is available.
%
%\paragraph{Chicken and turkeys} The total number of cattle slaughtered in Ontario (including both federally and provincially licensed facilities) is obtained from \citet{SlaughterFederalPoultry}.
%
%\paragraph{Rabbits} Only the number of rabbits culled in provincially inspected plants is reported \citep{SlaughterProvincialRabbits}.
%
%
%The live weight of each animal slaughtered $\left( W_{live} \right) $ is computed through the average warm carcass weight $\left( W_{carcass_{j}} \right) $ and the live to carcass weight ratio $\left(\eta_{\text{carcass to live}_{j}} \right) $, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:weightanimals}. The difference between the live and carcass weights are assumed to be slaughterhouse waste, Eq. \ref{eq:slaughterhousewaste}.

%\subsection{P flows in live animal imports and exports}
%Live animals imported and exported represent a significant flow of phosphorus entering and leaving the province of Ontario. Provincial imports and exports of cattle, hogs, and sheep are retrieved from \citet{CattleImportsExports,HogsImportsExports,SheepImportsExports} respectively. We note that data regarding the imports and exports of live poultry were not available, and data for the imports and exports of hogs are only reported since 2007. The imports of cattle and sheep are usually larger than the exports of these animals. Conversely, the exports of hogs are significantly larger than their imports in the region.
%
%The phosphorus flows within the animals involved in imports and exports operations are estimated based on the phosphorus contents reported in Table \ref{table:CarcassLiveWeightTatio}.
%
%\section{Comparison with previous studies}
%There exist previous studies mapping the phosphorus flows within the Canadian province of Ontario. Particularly, the work of \citet{BurrowsReport} performs an estimation of the phosphorus flows associated with the natural, industrial, municipal, and agricultural systems. However, a number of discrepancies have been found between this work and the report of \citet{BurrowsReport}, which are analyzed in the following sections. 
%
%\subsection{Livestock feed}
%The estimation of phosphorus contained in livestock feed is $\approx 5$ times larger in the study of \citet{BurrowsReport} than the results obtained in this work. This due to the discrepancy in  phosphorus intake of the different types of livestock, mainly in the P uptake of poultry. \citet{BurrowsReport} assume that poultry's feed is 1 kg per day of dry matter intake (DMI), conating 1-1.5\%. This result in a yearly phosphorus intake of 1.83-5.48 kg P. This value is significantly larger than the P intake for poultry considered in this studied, which are in the range 0.10-28 $\sfrac{\text{kg P}}{\text{year}}$ according to \citet{NetherlandsCompositions}. Although this study is performed in the Netherlands, the values provided are in agreement with the data reported for Canada by \citet{VanStaden2021}. However, the data reported by \citet{NetherlandsCompositions} is used in this work since more detailed data is provided.
%
%\subsection{Manure}
%\citet{BurrowsReport} and this study obtain estimation of phosphorus flows in manure within the same order of magnitude, although the result of the first study is approximately 2.5 times larger phosphorus in manure estimated in this work. We believe that the contributors to this discrepancy are the use of a unique value of manure production and composition for both sow and gilts assumed by \citet{BurrowsReport}, while we considered tailored values for each one of them, and secondly and mainly, their assumption of a unique and too large manure production value, 0.65 $\sfrac{\text{kg manure}}{\text{day}}$, for broilers, laying hens, pullets, and turkeys. This value seems too excessive for laying hens and broilers, which average weight in Canada in the year 2011 is reported to be 1.66 kg \citep{CanadaChickenWeight}. Attending to this, the assumption of laying hens and broilers produce manure for one third of their live weight on a daily basis seems unlikely to be reasonable. This reasoning can also be applied to the case of pullets. 
%
%\subsection{Agricultural products}
%\subsubsection{Milk}
%Significant discrepancies are found in the phosphorus flows associated with milk production between this study and the report performed by \citet{BurrowsReport}. The source of this disagreement is the data on milk production in Ontario in the year 2011. \citet{MilkOntario} report a milk production in Ontario for this year of $2,539 \cdot 10^{6}$ liters of milk, while the data provided by \citet{BurrowsReport} for the same year and province is $9.5 \cdot 10^{6}$ liters of milk
%
%\subsubsection{Eggs}
%A discrepancy of three orders of magnitude in the phosphorus outputs contained in eggs has been found. It is believed that this difference is due to the fact that \citet{BurrowsReport} report an egg production in Ontario for the year 2011 of 242,059 dozens of eggs in Ontario, while \citet{EggOntario} report that the production of eggs for the same spatio-temporal context of $242,059 \cdot 10^{3}$ dozens.
%
%\subsubsection{Slaughter products}
%Large discrepancies in the phosphorus contained in meat production and slaughterhouse waste is found between both reports. This can be due that in the work of \citet{BurrowsReport} is reported that 95,346, 365,868, 273,676 and 16,178,255 heads of bovine, porcine, ovine, and poultry animals were slaughtered in Ontario for the year 2011. These numbers are in general agreement with the data reported by \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat, SlaughterFederalPoultry} for provincially licensed facilities. However, according with \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat, SlaughterFederalPoultry}, a large number of animals are slaughtered in federally licensed in 2011 facilities located in Ontario, i.e., 610,485 and 4,086,081 heads of bovine and porcine animals, in addition to the ovine animals which data is reported aggragated for Ontario and the western provinces. These animals are estimated as described in Section \ref{section:PSlaughterProducts}. therefore, it is believed that the phosphorus flows reported by \citet{BurrowsReport} are estimated only for animals slaughtered in provincially licensed facilities, missing those flows originated in federally licensed facilities.
%
%\section{Field crop and vegetable sector}
%Phosphorus inputs associated with the grow of crops and vegetables are the result of fertilizer application to croplands, while the outputs include the phosphorus uptake by crops, and the phosphorus released into the environment, which can be retained in soil or transported by runoff and erosion, \textcolor{red}{as shown in Fig. ?}
%
%\subsection{Fertilizer application}
%\textcolor{red}{Add little intro}
%
%\subsubsection{Fertilizer applied to field crops} \label{section:FertilizerFieldCrops}
%Phosphorus applied as fertilizer to field crops of Ontario $\left( P_{fertilizer_{field}, Ontario} \right) $ is estimated based on the inputs of fertilizer products containing phosphorus at provincial level reported by \citet{FertilizerShipments}. Phosphorus applied to non-field crops, including greenhouse and nursery crops, is not accounted as phosphorus inputs to crop fields, so that the phosphate applied to greenhouse and nursery crops is subtracted from the total phosphate shipments. This correction is performed based on the total expenses on fertilizers in Ontario $\left(Cost_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario} \right)$, and for greenhouses and nursery crops $\left(Cost_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}, \ Ontario} \right)$ in Ontario \citep{FarmExpensesStatsCanada}, as the fertilizers expenditures for these crops are proportionally larger, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntario}. Average fertiliser expenditures between the years 2015-2020 are used. \textcolor{red}{This approach assumes that the phosphorus content of fertilizer used in the different crops is similar.}
%%This correction, based on the assumption that all fertilizers land receive the same amount of phosphorus, is performed by estimating the fraction of land devoted to greenhouses in relation to the total cropland area at census division level \citep{LandInputsStatsCanada, GreenhouseProductsStatsCanada}
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{field}, Ontario} = P_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario} \cdot \left(1- \frac{Cost_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}, \ Ontario}}{Cost_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario}}\right)  \label{eq:PFertilizerOntario}
%\end{align}
%
%%For census division $CD$, phosphorus inputs in the form of fertilizer applied to field crops $\left( P_{fertilizer_{field}, CD}\right) $
%The allocation of phosphorus applied to field crops to each census division $CD$ $\left( P_{fertilizer_{field}, CD}\right) $ is performed according to the fraction of fertilized area of each census division $\left(Area_{fertilized, CD} \right) $ over the total fertilized area in Ontario $\left(Area_{fertilized, Ontario} \right) $ \citep{LandInputsStatsCanada}, deducting the areas corresponding to non-field crops, i.e., greenhouses and nursery crops $\left( Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}\right) $ \citep{OntarioGreenhousesUsePerCDStatsCanada}, Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntarioCD}. The areas reported in the census of agriculture of 2016 are considered since the datasets reported includes data for all census divisions.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{field}, CD} = P_{fertilizer_{field}, Ontario} \cdot \frac{Area_{fertilized, CD} - Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, CD}}{Area_{fertilized, Ontario}-Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, Ontario}} \label{eq:PFertilizerOntarioCD}
%\end{align}
%
%%Fertilizer expenses of field crops, greenhouses, and nursery crops are retrieved from \citep{FarmExpensesStatsCanada}
%%\citep{OntarioLandUseOMAFRA, OntarioLandUseStatsCanada, OntarioGreenhousesUsePerCDStatsCanada}.
%
%\subsubsection{Fertilizer applied to non-field crops}
%Phosphorus applied to non-field crops as fertilizer in Ontario $\left( P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, Ontario} \right) $ is estimated as the product of the total phosphorus inputs in the form of fertilizers in Ontario and the fraction of fertilizer expenses for greenhouse and nursery crops over the total fertilizer expenditures in the province, similarly to Section \ref{section:FertilizerFieldCrops}, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonField}.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, Ontario} = P_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario} \cdot \frac{Cost_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}, \ Ontario}}{Cost_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario}} \label{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonField}
%\end{align}
%
%The allocation of phosphorus applied to non-field crops to each census division $\left(P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, CD} \right) $ is performed according to the fraction of non-field crops area $\left( Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, CD} \right) $ over the total area of greenhouse and nursery crops in Ontario $\left(Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, Ontario} \right) $, Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonFieldCD}, analogous to Section \ref{section:FertilizerFieldCrops}.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, CD} = P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, Ontario} \cdot \frac{Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, CD}}{Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, Ontario}} \label{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonFieldCD}
