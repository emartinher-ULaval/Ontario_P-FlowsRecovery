These methods are based on exploring the weight space in order to describe the preferences that make each alternative the most preferred one, or that would give a certain rank for a speciﬁc alternative. The main results of the analysis are rank acceptability indices, central weight vectors and conﬁdence factors for diﬀerent alternatives. The rank acceptability indices describe the variety of diﬀerent preferences resulting in a certain rank for an alternative, the central weight vectors represent the typical preferences favouring each alternative, and the conﬁdence factors measure whether the criteria measurements are suﬃciently accurate for making an informed decision.},

	abstract = {Animal manure contains nutrients [primarily nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] and organic material that are beneficial to crops. Unfortunately, for economic and logistics reasons, most manure tends to be applied to soils near where it is generated. Over time P concentrations in soils where dairy manure is applied builds up, often in excess of crop demands, and its potential loss in runoff poses a risk to water quality. We previously described, and have subsequently built, a full-scale version of a MAnure PHosphorus EXtraction (MAPHEX) System capable of removing greater than 90\% of the P from manures. While originally designed to remove phosphorus, we postulated that the MAPHEX System was also capable of removing odor and microbes, and of concentrating alkalinity into a solid, economically transported form. In this study the MAPHEX System was shown to be highly versatile at removing greater than 90\% of the phosphorus from a wide range of dairy manures. In addition, the study showed that the System is also capable of concentrating and recovering alkalinity from manures, while also removing over 80\% of microbes and reducing the odor of the effluent applied to fields by half.},

	abstract = {Lowering the phosphorus (P) content of animal manure is one approach of addressing concerns over surplus P accumulation in soils resulting from land application of animal manure. We sought to develop a treatment system for liquid manures that conserves manure nitrogen (N) while removing most of the manure P. Initial evaluation of a treatment system involving manure solid separation and precipitation of dissolved P with an alkaline salt (Ca(OH)2) resulted in poor liquid/solid separation and poor dissolved P removal and created conditions promoting ammonia-N (NH3-N) volatilization. As a result, we developed a three-stage system with iterative solid removal and acid salt (ferric sulfate –Fe2(SO4)3) sorption of dissolved P: (1) removal of bulk and intermediate sized solids ({\textgreater}25 μm); (2) chemical treatment to convert dissolved P; and (3) final removal of fine solids and chemically sorbed P. When tested on manure slurries from 150 and 2700 cow dairies, 96\% to 99\% aqua regia extractable P was removed along with 92\% to 94\% of the solids, resulting in liquid manure filtrates with N:P ratios greater than 19:1. While costs of treatment were roughly \$38 kg-1 P removed, equivalent to \$750 cow-1 yr-1, we anticipate that refinement of the process and beneficial uses of the solid materials (bedding, compost, etc.) will improve cost-efficacy considerably.},
