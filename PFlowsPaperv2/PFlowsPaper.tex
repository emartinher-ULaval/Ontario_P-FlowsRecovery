\section{Introduction}
Phosphorus is an essential element for the production of food. It has been intensively used for crop and livestock production since the development of synthetic fertilizers and feed supplements in the XIX and XX centuries \citep{Kausar19}. The combination of synthetic fertilizers with other modern intensive agricultural techniques have increased the productivity of agriculture and farming industries \citep{pingali2012green}.
However, the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture has resulted in the over-application of phosphorus \citep{reid2019phosphorus}, while the run of intensive livestock operations,
%also known as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) \citep{animal_unit_definition},
result in important difficulties in the management of the large amounts of manure produced. This is often spread on lands in the vicinity of the livestock operations, which in turn leads to the accumulation of phosphorus in the soil. Although soil acts as a phosphorus reservoir \citep{ehlert2003potential}, building-up a legacy P that can be used for future crops, it can also be transported to waterbodies by erosion and runoff, resulting in the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.

The dual dimension of the anthropogenic use of phosphorus, i.e., its key role in the food production system and the negative environmental impacts associated with the phosphorus used in intensive agricultural techniques, has been stated by the United Nations Environment Assembly in the resolution UNEP/EA.5/Res.2 \citep{UN_Phosphorus}. An additional factor to be considered for addressing the phosphorus challenge is the non-renewable nature of phosphorus, since the phosphorus consumed is not replenished by natural means at human time scale, and there is currently no known synthetic substitute for this material \citep{cordell2009story}. Since phosphorus reserves are concentrated in a few number of regions, the supply of phosphorus from a limited number of suppliers lacks resilience and it has been proven that it can be globally disrupted by regional events and conflicts
%, resulting geopolitical tensions
\citep{FAO_UkraineWar}. As a consequence, the recovery and recycling of phosphorus is not just a desirable but also a necessary approach to assure sustainable, reliable, and sovereign food production systems. 

Although the main uses of phosphorus are in the agri-food sector, phosphorus is also involved in other industrial activities, including steel, chemical, and forestry industries. Henceforth, phosphorus is a key material for many aspects of human development. As a result, the mapping of phosphorus flows involved in human activities to detect opportunities for recovery and recycling is essential 
to determine the fraction of phosphorus which recovery is viable, promoting a circular economy that
%for, in a second stage, assess amount of phosphorus that is viable to recover, the economical costs involved, and the 
enhances the sustainability of food production systems in terms of resiliency, savings from the reduction of phosphorus imports, and  mitigation of phosphorus pollution.
on the regions implementing strategies for phosphorus recovery and recycling.
The detailed quantification of phosphorus flows has been addressed in the literature for certain sectors, particularly for the agri-food sector \citep{boh2020nitrogen, zhou2021model, nesme2018global}. In addition, phosphorus flows have also been studied at global \citep{villalba2008global, chen2016half} and national scales \citep{van2016phosphorus, klinglmair2015phosphorus}, although these studies tend to
aggregate the flows by major sectors, resulting in a lower flow resolution. 
%have a lower flow resolution since these are aggregated by major sectors. 

The works quantifying phosphorus often include qualitative recommendations to improve the phosphorus use efficiency and recycling \citep{van2016phosphorus, senthilkumar2012conceptual}, but they do not include quantitative assessments on the amount of phosphorus that is feasible to recover along with the costs involved. Conversely, those works focused on estimating the recoverable phosphorus and the associated recovery costs target specific activities such as livestock production \citep{martin2021geospatial, sampat2018technologies} and wastewater treatment \citep{egle_phosphorus_2016, nattorp2017cost}. However, a holistic approach mapping the phosphorus flows and identifying the key streams for phosphorus recovery and reuse is a crucial stage to promote the debate about global and regional circular nutrient economies and redistribution systems \citep{kahiluoto2021global}, and to design important aspects of future phosphorus recycling strategies such as the design of coordinated markets \citep{sampat2019coordinated} and incentive policies \citep{martin2022analysis}.

%lacking a holistic perspective of the phosphorus flows in the various human activities.

In this work, we intend to perform a holistic approach to phosphorus management,
%by mapping the phosphorus flows and identifying the opportunities for phosphorus
recovery, and recycling through the study of the Canadian province of Ontario. In a first stage, we proceed to map the phosphorus flows involved in the economical sectors of Ontario, i.e., the agricultural, industrial, and urban sectors. These data is used in a second stage to identify the flows in which phosphorus recovery is feasible, estimating the amount of phosphorus that could be recovered within the province.
%different scenarios regarding the technology readiness level of
Different phosphorus recovery technologies with technology readiness levels equal or above 6 are evaluated, as well as the phosphorus recovery costs of each one of them. Finally, we discuss the implications that would be derived from implementing active phosphorus recovery and recycling approaches regarding phosphorus supply and use in Ontario.

\section{Methods}
%\subsection{Scope}
%We seek to quantify the phosphorus flows used in human activities, including the agricultural, urban, and industrial sectors. 

%The assessment is performed dividing the target sector in two subsectors, i.e., livestock and crop production, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Scope}. These subsectors are in turn sub-divided into specific activities, such as animal feeding, manure production, fertilizer application, etc.

\subsection{Spatial  and temporal boundaries}
%Phosphorus flows have been mapped within the Canadian province of Ontario, and thus the political borders of Ontario has been considered as the boundaries for 
Phosphorus flows have been mapped through a material flow analysis (MFA) \citep{brunner2016handbook} conducted within the political boundaries of the Canadian province of Ontario using data reported for the year 2019. 
%In those cases where the data was available, the distribution of phosphorus flows within Ontario has also been studied at Census Division level \citep{CensusDivisionCD}. The database collecting the IDs of Ontario Census Divisions, their names, and geospatial information is taken from \citet{CensusDivisionOpendatasoft}.

%\subsection{Temporal boundaries}
%The study has being performed for year 2019 since the most of data required is available for this year.
%In addition, the temporal evolution of the largest phosphorus flows, i.e., agricultural and wastewater phosphorus flows, has been studied for a period of 13 years from 2007 to 2019.
%%The study has being performed for years 2001-2021. However, for the years 2001-2006 and 2020-2021 there are some unavailable data, resulting in a partial loose resolution of the study. Therefore, the most complete information on agricultural P flows is reported for the years 2007-2019.

\subsection{Estimation of phosphorus flows}
The estimation of phosphorus flows in Ontario's economic sectors is based on
%the methodology described in \citet{PFlows_Ontario}. It is based on
the use open data sources, often from governmental institutions, complemented with information from scientific articles when needed. In the next sections, we describe the general procedure followed to estimate the phosphorus flows of each sector. For a comprehensive description of the procedure followed for estimating each particular phosphorus flow, we refer the reader to the methodology described in \citet{PFlows_Ontario}.

\subsubsection{Agriculture and aquaculture sector} \label{section:AgriSector}
Phosphorus flows in the agricultural sector are estimated based on production data of livestock and crop products, as well as on fertilizer application data.
%%For those production data were not available, a number of different methods were used to estimate the P flow based on approaches established in the literature. For example, 
%Phosphorus inflows associated with synthetic fertilizers could be directly estimated based on application data reported in the Fertilizer
%Shipments Survey (FSS) \citep{FertilizerShipments}. Phosphorus in livestock imports and exports is estimated from livestock trading data REF, multiplying the number of animals by the concentration of phosphorus in the different types of livestock REF,

Phosphorus in livestock feeding and manure
%meat and slaughterhouse waste
is estimated based on the number and type of animals reported for Ontario
%at Census Division level
in the Census of Agriculture, including cattle \citep{LivestockCensusCattle}, swine \citep{LivestockCensusPig}, poultry \citep{LivestockCensusPoultry}, and other livestock \citep{LivestockCensusSheep, LivestockCensusOtherLivestock},
%\citep{LivestockCensusCattle,LivestockCensusSheep,LivestockCensusPig,LivestockCensusPoultry,LivestockCensusOtherLivestock},
multiplied by the phosphorus feeding requirements and concentration of phosphorus in manure \citep{NetherlandsCompositions,BrownCompositions, VanStaden2021}.
%and carcasses REF respectively. 
%The Census of Agriculture is published by Statistics Canada every five years (i.e., 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016) for cattle52 REF, sheep53 REF, swine54 REF, poultry55 REF, and other livestock56 REF, with the exception of rabbits, where data is not available prior to 2009. The number of animals for the years in between census reporting have been estimated using a linear interpolation.
We assumed that the number of animals reported is throughout the year (i.e., the animals culled are replaced by new ones). However, in the case of broilers and turkeys, the number of animals reported by the livestock census have been reduced by a factor of 0.68 (broilers) and 0.80 (turkeys), since these animals have life cycles of 43 and 80 days respectively, meaning barns are empty for 20 days between cycles \citep{yang2007development}.

Phosphorus flows through the imports and exports of animals is estimated using data on animal imports and exports \citep{CattleImportsExports, HogsImportsExports, SheepImportsExports} multiplied by their phosphorus to live weight ratios \citep{NetherlandsCompositions}.

Phosphorus contained in meat and slaughterhouse waste is based on the number of animals slaughtered reported by both federally and provincially licensed meat plants \citep{SlaughterFederalRedMeat, SlaughterFederalPoultry} multiplied by the concentration of phosphorus in carcasses \citep{LivetoCarcassWeight,hayse1973eviscerated,brake1995relationship,NetherlandsCompositions}.

Phosphorus flows associated with the production of milk and eggs is based on provincial production data \citep{EggOntario,MilkOntario}, multiplying these products by their average phosphorus concentration \citep{NutrientValueHealthCanada,chambers2017chicken}.

Phosphorus applied to open fields as synthetic fertilizer is estimated based on the amount of fertilizer products traded to Ontario’s agricultural markets containing phosphorus \citep{FertilizerShipments}. 
%The distribution of phosphorus fertilizers among the Census Division of the province is based on the fraction of fertilized area of each census division, i.e., dividing the reported area of land fertilized for each census division by the total fertilized area of land in Ontario, removing the areas that correspond with greenhouse crops101, 102 103 REF. 
Regarding manure, we assume that all of the manure generated by livestock is applied in crop fields \citep{IROWC_PHandbook}.

The uptake of phosphorus by crops is determined based on the area used in each census division \citep{CensusDivisionOpendatasoft} to grow each type of crops by census division \citep{FieldCropsCensus,FieldVegetablesCensus,GreenhousesCensus} multiplied by the specific yield and phosphorus content for each crop type \citep{USDAHandbook}.  The phosphorus uptake by crops is divided according to whether it uptake in the grain, fruit or vegetable, or straw and stover components of each type of crop. This is necessary to determine the amount of phosphorus that flows within food or feed (i.e.,grains, fruits and vegetables), while straw and stover remain in the field after harvesting as crop residues.

A fraction of the phosphorus applied to crop fields as manure of synthetic fertilizer is lost through erosion, runoff, and drainage. The magnitude of this flow depends on a range of factors, including the amount of phosphorus applied; soil composition, texture, and slope; and precipitations, resulting in a complex and data-intensive process for estimating the phosphorus transported out of the crop fields. As an approximation, we have estimated the phosphorus losses by using export coefficients determined for crop fields in Ontario corrected to account for both surface and subsurface runoffs for synthetic fertilizers (1.267 kg/ha/year), and liquid and solid manure (2.548 kg/ha/year and 1.717 kg/ha/year respectively) \citep{zhang2015tile, wang2018solid,tan2011surface}. In addition, a fraction of the P supplied to crop fields is not taken up by the plants and remains in soil, resulting in the accumulation of P over time as a result of synthetic fertilizer and manure over over sustained periods of time, often applying phosphorus in greater quantities than crops require to ensure satisfactory yields \citep{reid2019addressing}. This buildup is often referred to as “legacy P”, and it is estimated as the balance between phosphorus inflows to crop fields (application of manure and synthetic fertilizers) and outflows (crop food and feed products, crop residues, and phosphorus losses by erosion and runoff).

Regarding greenhouse crops, the data available was limited, resulting in an estimation of phosphorus applied as synthetic fertilizers based on the sum of phosphorus uptake by greenhouse crops
%(i.e., tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers)119
and phosphorus releases from greenhouse irrigation systems also known as greenhouse nutrient feedwater (GNF) systems \citep{GNFOntario}. The phosphorus uptake by greenhouse crops is determined by multiplying the production of greenhouse crops \citep{HorticulturalOntario} by the phosphorus content of each vegetable type \citep{USDAHandbook}. The phosphorus releases from the GNF systems was estimated based on the average concentration of phosphorus in GNF outlet streams for  Ontario, 33.6 mg/L \citep{GreenhouseReleases}, and the total water discharges from GNF systems, assuming that the water discharges are equivalent to 25\% of the total water applied in greenhouses, which corresponds with the worst-case scenario of no water recirculation in the GNF systems \citep{GNFOntario}. The average water consumption in greenhouses in Ontario was assumed to be 1,000 L/m\textsuperscript{2}/year \citep{GrowingVeggiesOntario}. We have also estimated the phosphorus releases from the seasonal workers live in households in the vicinity of the greenhouses that may use septic systems, considering that the seasonal labour force in Ontario greenhouses is estimated to be 6,699 workers \citep{GreenhouseWorkers}, and an average phosphorus load rate of f 0.0156 kg P/person/week from septic systems \citep{oldfield2020estimation}.

Phosphorus in aquaculture are mainly due to supply of feed as part of fish feed the grow of trouts, part of which is uptake by fishes, while the rest of phosphorus is released into aquatic ecosystems since aquaculture effluents are directly discharged to the environment \citep{OntarioAquaculture}. The amount phosphorus uptakes by fishes
%supplied to aquaculture as fish feed is taken from, while the phosphorus uptakes by fishes are 
is calculated multiplying the fish production \citep{StatisticsCanadaAquaculture}, by their phosphorus content \citep{CanadianNutrientFile}, while the phosphorus content in the aquaculture waste effluents of Ontario is estimated to be 10 kg of phosphorus per ton of fish produced \citep{bureau2003chemical}. The sum of phosphorus uptakes by fishes and phosphorus in aquaculture waste effluents result in the phosphorus supplied to aquaculture as fish feed.

\subsubsection{Industrial sector}
Phosphorus flows through imports, production, exports and waste for the food, steel, and forestry industries of Ontario were mapped.

%{\color{red} REVISAR POR SIDNEY }
Processed food imports and exports
are estimated scaling each type of food 
%available in Canada \citep{FoodAvailableCanada} 
traded in Canada \citep{TradeDataOnlineCanada}
with the population of Ontario \citep{PopulationCanada}.
%and then subtracting the amount of each type of food produced within Ontario.
The phosphorus contained in each type of imported and exported food is estimated multiplying the amount of ech type of traded food by its phosphorus content \citep{CanadianNutrientFile}. Phosphorus flows in the form of food and organic waste are based on applying food loss factors for the steps associated with food processing, from the production of food raw materials to consumption \citep{FoodLossesFAO}, considering the food production and import values estimated in Section \ref{section:AgriSector}.

The steel industry is the first non-food sector in terms of phosphorus use. The main phosphorus inflows of steel manufacturing are associated with the use of iron ore, coal, and coke, while the main outflow of phosphorus is within slag, which remove most of the impurities from steel, including phosphorus. It must be noted that, although some minor amounts of phophosphorus can be desired in steel for making anti-corrosion surface coatings, it is largely considered an impurity in the steel manufacturing process. Phosphorus in these flows is estimated multiplyting their average phosphorus content (0.06\% P in iron ore, 0.05\% P for coal, 0.4\% P in slag, and 0.01\% in steel) \citep{yokoyama2007separation} by the steel production capacity of the facilities located in Ontario \citep{CheminfoServices, AlgomaSteel, Stelco, PFlows_Ontario} and the imports and exports of these materials \citep{WorldIntegratedTradeSolution, InterprovincialImportsExports}.

Phosphorus flows in Ontario's forestry industry includes wood harvesting, wood products manufacturing, as well as the production of pulp and paper. The estimation of these phosphorus flows are the result of multiplying the production data of wood, wood products, pulp and paper, and their retrospectives imports, exports, and waste streams \citep{CanadianForestServiceStatistics, InterprovincialImportsExports}, by the average phosphorus content, which is assumed to be 0.01\% for wood \citep{sardans2013tree} and 0.005\% for pulp and paper products.

The general chemical facilities located in Ontario report 350 t/year of phosphorus as waste \citep{PFlows_Ontario}, in addition of imports and exports of chemical products. However, there exist a significant fraction of phosphorus used in the industrial sector that cannot be tracked due to the lack of data. Regarding other industrial activities which could involve the use of phosphorus, the local production of phosphorus is assumed to be negligible since phosphorus is not mined or refined in Ontario, and the synthetic phosphorus fertilizer imports are accounted in the agricultural section.

%{\color{red}Ask sidney what to do with food industry, and pet feed. My approach is to merge all of them as it is currently in the figure, but confirm with her}

\subsubsection{Urban sector}
In this section we include the phosphorus inflows and outflows through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), septic systems, and food and organic waste management facilities (landfills, composting sites, and anaerobic digestion facilities).

%{\color{red}Jorge do you mind if the purposes of the papaer we stick with just one method? I think it is better, otherwise it becomes lengthy and confusing}

Phosphorus flows through WWTPs is estimated combining data from the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) \citep{NPRI}, a public database of releases, disposals and transfers of pollutants
%, including industrial facilities
, and data from the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations (WSER) database \citep{WSER}. Since the NPRI only contains data of those facilities that meet certain regulatory requirements, the information of this database must be complemented with the data from the WSER database, which includes information of Canadian WWTPs at federal, provincial, and municipal levels. The estimations on phosphorus flows through WWTPs are valitaed using the Municipal Treated Wastewater Effluent (MTWE) database \citep{MTWE}, which collects annual data on water quality data and effluent levels for WWTPs in Ontario.
%{\color{red}
We note that this data set only provides information about phosphorus releases from municipal WWTPs, but it does not collect phosphorus flows through sludge disposals.

This methodology is shown in Figure \ref{fig:MethodWWTPs}.

There exist households that are not connected to any sewer systems, but they are equipped with septic systems to perform a rough treatment of the wastewater produced prior to its release into the environment. This typically consist into a septic tank that separates solid matter from the wastewater, and a drainfield where the effluent is discharged. The estimation of phosphorus releases from septic systems is based on the fraction of households equipped with these systems, estimated on 13\% \citep{CanadaSepticSystems}, which are inhabited by an average of 2.58 individuals \citep{CanadaPersonPerHouse}. The average phosphorus load rate from septic systems assumed is 0.81 kg of phosphorus per person per year
%for the Lake Erie Basin in Ontario by
\citep{oldfield2020estimation}.

\subsection{Phosphorus recovery techniques} \label{section:PRecoveryTechs}
There exist different processes for phosphorus recovery from different sources which technical viability has been proven or is at advanced development stage, i.e., systems with technologies readiness level (TRL) \citep{TRLDefinitions} of 6 or above (commercial or pilot plant stage). Since the flows from different processes have different properties, the techniques for phosphorus recovery vary between sectors and flows and, therefore, their recovery efficiencies, costs, and products obtained are different. Table \ref{table:TechParam} shows a summary of the specifications of the phosphorus recovery technologies for different flows, including literature references where comprehensive descriptions of each system and its specifications can be found. We note that the phosphorus recovery processes currently available exceed the systems included in this work, nonetheless, the processes considered in this study are a selection of the main techniques for phosphorus recovery.
%although different processes may have been developed through the foundations of the same technique,
However, different processes may have been developed on the foundations of the same technique,
e.g., the multiple processes are based on struvite precipitation. 
%These table is based on different processes at different development level, from commercial to pilot plant stages.
%A collection of phosphorus recovery technologies for different streams can be found in the Table ??? of the Supplementary Material. 
%Different scenarios are studied considered the technology readiness level (TRL) of the processes in order to determine the phosphorus that could be immediately recovered using commercial technologies (Scenario 1), the phosphorus that could be recovered in a near future by using technologies above pilot plant development stage (Scenario 2), and finally  prospective assessment of phosphorus recovery systems that at early research stages (Scenario 3). 

Phosphorus recovery costs include operating and annualized capital costs. Capital costs are annualized through the application of an annual capital charge ratio $\left( ACCR\right)$ as defined by \citet{towler2013chemical}, assuming a typical interest rate of 5\% and a plant lifetime of 20 years. Dynamic phosphorus recovery costs in function of the processing capacity have been considered in order to capture the economies of scale for those technologies for which sufficient data are available.

In general terms, the processes for phosphorus recovery and recycling can be classified into those employed for the treatment of liquid streams, which are based on the formation of precipitates through the direct treatment of the liquid effluent, and those processes employed for the treatment of solid fractions, which usually require the pretreatment of the waste, e.g., through an incineration stage.

Phosphorus in manure represent an important flow within the agricultural sector.
%Phosphorus can be recovered from different flows within the agricultural sector, including the production of manure. 
The techniques used for phosphorus recovery from cattle and swine manure differ for the liquid and solid fractions. Struvite precipitation is he dominant technology for phosphorus recovery from liquid manure, existing different processes for struvite production based on the type of reactors used with similar recovery efficiencies but different treatment capacities, and thus different recovery costs \citep{martin2021geospatial}. Additionally, there exist modular processes based on physical separations oriented to small-scale intensive livestock facilities \citep{church_versatility_2018}. The recovery of phosphorus from the solid fraction of manure involves the incineration of the waste, and the further processing of the ashes, recovering phosphorus precipitates or phosphoric acid \citep{jupp2021phosphorus,egle_phosphorus_2016}. Phosphorus recovery from poultry litter is based on acid extraction and further precipitation \citep{szogi2008phosphorus}.
%Since this technology shows a lower development level, their use has been considered in Scenario 2, see Section ??.

Slaughterhouse waste is a flow from the food processing industry which can be targeted for phosphorus recovery. It should be noted that slaughterhouse is comprised by a liquid (slaughterhouse wastewater) and a solid fraction (animal carcass waste).
%and, therefore, the phosphorus recovery systems for each flow will differ.
Similarly to phosphorus recovery from liquid manure, phosphorus recovery from slaughterhouse wastewater is performed through through struvite precipitation \citep{Pearl2Kcost2}, while the animal animal carcass waste is incinerated and phosphorus is recovered from ashes in form of calcium carbonate or phosphoric acid \citep{jupp2021phosphorus}.
%Phosphorus technologies suitable for phosphorus recovery from these sources are collected in Table \ref{table:TechParam}.

Municipal wastewater contains significant amounts of phosphorus that can be recovered. It must be noted that phosphorus outflows from WWTPs are divided into phosphorus contained in the treated water and phosphorus contained in sludge. Phosphorus contained in water can be recovered through the formation of precipitates such as struvite or calcium phosphate, while phosphorus contained in sludge can be recovered either through the direct processing of sludge producing precipitates, of from sludge ashes after an incineration stage, obtaining different products such as phosphoric acid or calcium phosphate.
%, as shown in Table \ref{table:TechParam}.

\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{Phosphorus flows in Ontario}

Figure \ref{fig:FigFlowsSummary} summarizes the phosphorus flows in the province of Ontario. It can be observed that phosphorus flows in anthropogenic activities can be divided into 3 independent networks, i.e., the flow of phosphorus involved the production and processing of food (including the treatment of organic solid waste and  wastewater), the flow of phosphorus used in the steel and chemical industries, and the phosphorus involved in the forestry industry.

The main inflows of the food production and processing network are those associated with the supply of synthetic fertilizers and livestock feed, accounting for 55.6 and 21.8 kt/year respectively. Other phosphorus imports in Ontario are made in the form of food products (4.7 kt/year) and aquaculture feed (0.07 kt/year). Crop residues and manure are the main phosphorus waste effluent from the agricultural sector, accounting for 32.5 and 30.6 kt/year respectively.
%However, it must be noted the different properties of these materials.
While crop residues are usually left in the cropfields, transferring part of the phosphorus taken by crops back to soil and acting as soil amendment materials,
%due to their carbon content
manure produced in intensive livestock operations is a spatially concentrated point source of phosphorus releases, resulting in the accumulation of phosphorus in the vicinity of these facilities. As a consequence, the production of manure can result in negative environmental impacts and requires of adequate management strategies. The food processing industry involves the largest flows within the province, which can be classified as plant and animal-based food products, and slaughterhouse waste, resulting in phosphorus flows of 43.2, 10.3, and 3.8 kt/year respectively. A significant fraction of end-flows are waste flows in the form of landfill (37.5 kt/year), composting (2.1 kt/year), and anaerobic digestion (1.4 kt/year) disposals, as well as wastewater (7.8 kt/year). Phosphorus exports out of Ontario are performed through the exports of food products and livestock, accounting for 10.8 and 1.8 kt/year respectively.

	\label{fig:FigFlowsSummary}
\end{figure}

Chemical industry involve significant phosphorus flows, importing 22.2 kt/year into the province, while the exports represent 14.0 kt/year. This sector produces 0.35 kt/year of phosphorus that is classified as waste. However, an important fraction of phosphorus used by this sector (11.7 kt/ton) cannot be tracked and, therefore, it is unknown what is the real amount of phosphorus disposed as waste.  Steel production imports 8.3 kt/year of phosphorus, of which 7.0 kt/year ends as steel waste or slag, while the phosphorus outflows through steel materials are 1.4 kt/year.

Phosphorus imports from the forestry industry are 0.38 kt/year, while 2.3 kton/year of phosphorus is taken from local wood harvested within Ontario. This sector releases 0.4 kton/year of phosphorus in the form of wood and pulp waste, while 0.81 kt/year of phosphorus is exported out of the province as wood, manufactured wood products, pulp, and paper.


\subsection{Potential of phosphorus recovery in Ontario}

The potential for phosphorus recovery in the province of Ontario
%through the  deployment of different processes for the recovery of phosphorus from different flows
is assessed in this section. As shown in Section \ref{section:PRecoveryTechs}, different processes can be employed for the recovery of phosphorus from the same stream. However, each system is designed for operating under certain conditions and they have different processing capacities. As a result, phosphorus recovery efficiency and cost may vary between technologies for the treatment of the same flow. In order to explore this variability between phosphorus recovery systems, all the systems described in Table \ref{table:TechParam} are evaluated. {\color{red}{The results obtained in terms of phosphorus recovered and recovery cost for each technology and flow are collected in the Supplementary Material}}. Two scenarios are selected for deeper analysis, the minimum cost scenario, in which the most economical technology is selected, and the maximum recovery scenario, in which the phosphorus recovery system selected is the one recovery the largest amount of phosphorus.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Agricultural sector}
Manure is an agricultural flow from which effective phosphorus recovery might be achieved since it can be collected from the intensive livestock operations and be further treated \citep{schoumans2010phosphorus}. The inventory of cattle, swine, poultry, and other livestock for Ontario in 2019 is 1,376,984, 506,768, 148,508, and 135,725 animal units respectively, resulting in the release of 13,274, 8,569, 6,457, and 2,283 metric tonnes of phosphorus per year through manure respectively. An animal unit is defined as an animal equivalent of 1,000 pounds (453.6 kg) live weight \citep{animal_unit_definition}.

Phosphorus recovery from manure is highly influenced by the economies of scale and, therefore, by the scale of the livestock operations \citep{martin2021geospatial}. Since no data on the size distribution of livestock operations in Ontario is available, the average sizes of livestock facilities reported by \citet{CAFOSAvgSize} for the year 2019 are considered, resulting in average sizes for cattle, swine, pultry and other livestock (primarily sheep and lambs) facilities of 98, 168, 15 and 16 animal units respectively. The number of cattle, swine, poultry, and other livestock operations obtained is 14,051, 3,022, 10,069, and 8,636 respectively, which is in alignment with the number of livestock facilities reported by \citet{CAFOSAvgSizeAndNumber}.

% animal units for year 2019, which result in the release of 15,923 kt of manure per year and 13.27 kt of phosphorus per year, and for swine represent 506,768 animal units, 5,779 kt of manure per year, and 8.57 kt of phosphorus per year REF. 
Phosphorus is divided between the liquid and solid fractions of manure, being the solid fraction the one containing the largest amount of phosphorus, and thus the fraction from which larger quantities amounts of phosphorus can be recovered with lower costs, as it can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummary}. However, it must be noted that phosphorus recovery from solid manure involved more complex processes, since they include the incineration of the waste, which in turn makes the process more energy intensive and may result in environmentally harmful emissions of gases. Cattle manure contains the larges amount of phosphorus as a consequence of being the largest manure flow, followed by swine and poultry manure. However, the comparison of the average phosphorus recovery costs per kilogram of phosphorus recovered shows that phosphorus recovery from swine liquid manure is more cost-effective, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummarySpecific}. This is due to the size of the swine intensive facilities, which in average are comprised by a larger number of animal units that cattle intensive facilities. This reveals the important role of the economies of scale in phosphorus recovery. However, in general terms the small size of the livestock operations in Ontario results in high phosphorus recovery costs, whose values range between 200 and 700 EUR/kg P recovered. These costs are significantly higher than the phosphorus recovery costs reported by \citet{martin2022analysis} for the comparatively larger livestock operations of the U.S. states in the Great Lakes area, whose average sizes range from 630 and 2,600 animal units, resulting in phosphorus recovery costs between 13 and 73 USD/kilogram of phosphorus recovered. The phosphorus recovery efficiency is similar for all livestock types since the processes selected are the modular physical separation system MAPHEX due to the small scale of the livestock facilities.
%For the case of solid manure it can be observed that all livestock types show a similar average phosphorus recovery cost as a result of the lack of data to stimate the effect of the economies of scale of these processes.
It was not possible to evaluate the effect of the economies of scale for the processes intended to phosphorus recovery from the solid fraction of manure due to the lack of techno-economic data available for them.
%determined that the implementation of struvite production processes at livestock facilities is mainly driven by the scale of the CAFO, and thus they can be divided by into three clusters regarding the type of phosphorus recovery processes implemented, i.e., facilities with capacity for between 300 and 2,000 animal units, for between 2,000 and 5,000 animals units, and facilities large than 5,000 animal units. An animal unit (AU) is defined as an animal equivalent of 1,000 pounds (453.6 kg) live weight \citep{animal_unit_definition}. The most suitable phosphorus recovery for process for the facilities of each one of these clusters was determined by \citet{martin2021geospatial}, resulting in that  Multiform-type processes are the most suitable struvite produciton system for the cluster including the small-size CAFOs cluster (300-2,000 AUs), NuReSys-type systems are suitable for medium-size CAFOs (2,00-5,000 AUs), while that the suitable struvite system for large-scale CAFOs is Crystalactor-type processes. The investment and operating cost of these systems is collected in Table ?REF?.
%
%The number of cattle animals is reported by the Census of Agriculture at Census Division level REF, but no available data on CAFOs size is available for the province of Ontario. Since this information is essential to determine the suitable phopshorus recovery process to be considered, and in turn the phosphorus recovery cost, the distribution of CAFOs sizes has been approximated to the cattle and swine CAFOs size distribution of other regions in the vicinity of the Great Lakes area, namely Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The distribution of CAFOs size in each one of these regions has been approximated through a truncated normal distribution, since the possible size of livestock facilities is bounded between 300 animal units for being considered as an intensive livestock production facility REF, and 10,000 animal units in order to remove extra-large CAFOs that are outliers in the size distribution, avoiding excessive long tails distorting the distributions.
%For cattle CAFOs, it has been found that two scenarios can be identified, a first scenario (Scenario 1) where the average size of CAFOs is larger, around 2,400 animal units based on the parameters of the states of Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and a second scenario (Scenario 2) based on the states of Pennsylvania and Indiana where the average size of CAFOs is smaller, lower than 1,500 animal units. Two CAFOs size distributions are proposed for Ontario based on each one of these scenarios, estimating the parameters of Eq. REF as the average parameters of the distributions in each scenario, as shown in \ref{fig:CAFOsSize_Scenarios}. 
%For swine CAFOs, the size distribution patterns are similar for all the states studied, with the exception of the Wisconsi\ref{fig:Results_PlotSumn, which has been discarded due to the little number of swine facilities installed in this state. A truncated normal distribution with mean equal to 741 AUs and standard deviation equal to 456 AUs is assumed to stimate the distribution of swine CAFOs in Ontario, as shown in \ref{fig:CAFOsSize_Scenarios}.
%The distribution parameters for both cattle and swine CAFOs size are shown in Table \ref{table:CAFOsSizeScenarios}.
%The number of CAFOs in each cluster is determined through the Monte Carlo method, with the constrain that the sum of animal units of all CAFOs must not exceed the total number of animal units of Ontario, which for cattle is equal to 1,376,984 animal units for year 2019, which result in the release of 15,923 kt of manure per year and 13.27 kt of phosphorus per year, and for swine represent 506,768 animal units, 5,779 kt of manure per year, and 8.57 kt of phosphorus per year REF. The number of CAFOs belonging to each cluster are shown in Table \ref{table:CAFOsSizeScenarios}. Further details on the estimation of CAFOs size distribution can be found in the Supplementary Information, Section ??.

\subsubsection{Industrial and urban sector}
Industrial and urban sectors are grouped since some flows belong to both sectors, particularly those related with wastewater and the organic fraction of industrial and municipal solid waste, including food waste.

Slaughterhouse waste is an industrial flow from which phosphorus can be effectively recovered \citep{Pearl2Kcost2}. Data on individual capacities for the slaughterhouses in Ontario is not available to estimate the effect of the economies of scale on the cost of phosphorus recovery. Therefore, average slaughterhouse capacities are considered, which values are 104,017, 802,186, and $14.4 \cdot 10^6$ cattle, hog, and poultry heads slaughtered/$\left(\text{facility} \cdot \text{year}\right) $ respectively \citep{SlaughterhouseDistribution, SlaughterhousePoultryAverageSize}. Considering the inventory of slaughtered animals reported by \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat, SlaughterFederalPoultry}, 7, 6, and 17 cattle, hog, and poultry slaughtering facilities are obtained, with associated phosphorus flows of 317.4, 103.5, and 53.2 metric tonnes/$\left(\text{facility} \cdot \text{year}\right) $ respectively. Phosphorus flows from slaughtered sheep and rabbit are considered negligible due to the low number of animals slaughtered. Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummary} shows that most of phosphorus can be recovered from the solid fraction of waste due to its larger phosphorus content. The variations between the minimum cost and maximum recovery scenarios are not significant for the solid slaughterhouse waste flow. However, for slaughterhouse wastewater phosphorus recovery for the maximum recovery scenario increase by a factor of 2.3  over the minimum cost scenario, while the total recovery cost increases by a factor of 3.3, as it can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummarySpecific}. Therefore, the increase of phosphorus recovery efficiency results in a non-linear increase in the phosphorus recovery cost. The numerical results are collected in the Supplementary Material.
%The number of slaughtered animals can be found in Table ?? of Supplementary Material.

%\subsubsection{Urban sector}
Wastewater is a large flow containing significant amounts of phosphorus. Wastewater is colledted and directed to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). These facilities produces a liquid water effluent with adequate environmental parameters for being released into the environment, and a sludge flow from the primary and second treatments. Phosphorus can be recovered from both flows, although most of the phosphorus is contained in the sludge fraction.
The distribution of phosphorus assumed for treated liquid water and sludge is 14.1\% - 85.9\% respectively,
%\citep{PFlows_Ontario},
based on the data reported by NPRI and WSER databases \citep{NPRI, WSER}, which is in alignment with the distribution values reported by \citet{egle_phosphorus_2016}. The capacity of the wastewater treatment plants installed in Ontario, together with their phosphorus flows, have been analyzed to determine the effect of the economies of scale in the cost of phosphorus recovery.
%{\color{red}{Data on Ontario wastewater treatment plants capacity and phosphorus releases is collected in the Supplementary Material}}
%{\color{red}{*Jorge and Roy, would you agree with including this data as part of the Suplementary Material?*}}.
Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummary} shows that the potential for phosphorus recovery from sludge is greater than from the liquid fraction, as mentioned before. Little variation is observed between the minimum cost and maximum recovery scenarios for the recovery of phosphorus from sludge, which implies that there exist a certain degree of homogeneity in the current technologies for phosphorus recovery from sludge. This can also be appreciated in Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummarySpecific}. It must be noted that the phosphorus recovery systems from sludge ashes reveal to be more effective, including the incineration cost, than the direct recovery of phosphorus from sludge due to the higher recovery efficiency of the former ones. Conversely, the phosphorus recovery from the liquid wastewater fraction show a larger variability between both scenarios considered. The phosphorus recovered in the maximum recovery scenario is 1.7 times larger than in the minimum cost scenarios. However, this increase in the phosphorus recovery efficiency result in the increase of the recovery cost by a factor of 9.6, showing that similarly to the case of the liquid fraction of slaughterhouse waste, the achievement of greater recovery efficiencies through the use of more effective technologies result in an exponential increase of recovery costs.

Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummary} shows that the food and organic waste represent the largest potential for phosphorus recovery. However, it must be noted that this flow includes all those streams comprised by solid organic wastes other than slaughterhouse waste, including food processing waste, household food waste, and other municipal organic waste. Similarly to other solid fractions, the minimum cost and maximum recovery scenarios show a narrow variability regarding phosphorus recovered and recovery costs.

Finally, there are some processes under development for the recovery of phosphorus from steel production industry, particularly from steelmaking slag. These processes are based on selective leaching and further chemical precipitation to obtain solid phosphates \citep{du2022recovery, du2019separation} or magnetic-aid calcium phosphate precipitation \citep{yokoyama2007separation}. Although these are promising processes that can result in an effective recovery of phosphorus which can be further recycled, they are at early development stages and, thus, they have not been considered in this assessment.

\subsection{Economic implications of phosphorus recovery in Ontario}
In order to compare the costs derived from the recovery of anthropogenic phosphorus, Figure \ref{fig:CommodityPrices} shows the average phosphorus recovery cost in Ontario
along with the long-term social and environmental economical losses derived from uncontrolled releases of phosphorus into the environment estimated by \citet{sampat2021valuing},
and
the temporal evolution of prices for different phosphorus commodities reported by the World Bank's Commodity Markets report \citep{CommoditiesPrices}, i.e., phosphate rock, diammonium phosphate (DAP), and triple superphosphate (TSP) together. The costs are normalized per mass unit of phosphorus, assuming that the phosphorus content of commercial phosphorus rock ranges from 28 to 34\% in mass basis \citep{FAO_PUses, UMin_P}, while phosphorus content of DAP and TSP is 20\% and 19\% respectively. The prices have been adjusted to the year 2020 through the Consumer Price Index (CPI) elaborated by the U.S. Census Bureau \citep{CPIIndex}.

It can be observed that the average cost of phosphorus recovery in Ontario, valued around 36 EUR/kg of phosphorus recovered, is significantly lower than the economic losses derived from the release of phosphorus into the environment, estimated at 74.5 EUR/kg P in the context of state of Wisconsin, U.S. This provides an economical support to the recovery of phosphorus, since high long-term costs derived from the social and environmental damages caused by phosphorus releases into the environment could be avoided through the recovery of phosphorus from waste streams. Nevertheless, it can be observed that the cost of phosphorus obtained from recovery processes is more costly than phosphorus in commercial fertilizers obtained from mining, which reduces the economic incentives for the recovery and reuse of phosphorus. As a consequence, further support in form of environmental and/or agricultural regulations, phosphorus recovery incentives, or sustainability arguments are needed in order to promote the recovery and recycling of phosphorus.

Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:CommodityPrices} shows that average cost of phosphorus recovery within the province is around 36 EUR/kg of phosphorus recovered, however, in Figure \ref{fig:Results_PlotSummarySpecific} we can observe that phosphorus recovery costs can reach significantly higher values, particularly for the recovery of phosphorus from manure due to the lack of economies of scale of Ontario's livestock operations. Therefore, regional cooperative strategies could be implemented to develop a coordinated action against nutrient pollution, distributing the benefits and costs of phosphorus recovery, and prioritizing the total utility rather than the utility of each stakeholder, similarly to the cooperative approaches proposed for minimizing the cost of reducing greenhouse gases emissions from electricity generation \citep{galan2018time}.

\subsection{Potential for phosphorus recycling in Ontario}
%The scope of this study is oriented to the recycling of the phosphorus recovered and, therefore, the processes studied are those recovering phosphorus in an adequate for being further reused. 
Phosphorus recovered can be further recycled within the food production system, developing a circular economy around the use of phosphorus. Phosphorus recovery and recycling would result in curbing the depletion of phosphorus rock reserves and the reduction of the dependency on phosphorus supply from other regions.
%, which in turn increase the resiliency of the regional food production system, and minimize the environmental footprint of fertilizers production.
Considering these factors, there exist some governmental initiatives that, through the creation of different forums and platforms, aim to promote the recovery and recycling of phosphorus \citep{NRRPlatform, PFlows_Ontario}. In addition, the European Union is setting specific targets to reduce the use of non-renewable materials in fertilizer production \citep{EurpeanComissionNewFertilizersGoal} and to promote the use of waste-based fertilizers \citep{EurpeanComissionFertilizersRegulation}, encouraging the effective recovery and recycling of phosphorus, and they could serve as a guideline to support phosphorus recovery in other regions. 

The comparison between the phosphorus imported for the production of food within Ontario, i.e., in the form of fertilizer or animal feed, and the phosphorus that could be recovered, as it is shown in Figure \ref{fig:PSubstitution}, is a useful metric to determine the effectiveness of phosphorus recovery, and the potential reduction of phosphorus supplies from external sources. This assessment is limited to the food production sector depicted in Figure \ref{fig:FigFlowsSummary} since the recovery of phosphorus is performed in different flows belonging to this sector.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Phosphorus inputs for food production and phosphorus recovered per sector. S1 refers to the scenario minimizing phosphorus recovery cost, while S2 refers to the scenario maximizing phosphorus recovery.}
	\label{fig:PSubstitution}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:PSubstitution} shows that up to 88\% of the phosphorus used for food production, excluding imports of food that have been produce elsewhere, could be recovered and recycled in the best case scenarios where no phosphorus losses occur between the recovery and the reuse stages. An effective recycling of phosphorus implies the redistribution of this material from the locations where it is released to the livestock operations where it is used for livestock raise, or to phosphorus-deficient cropfields, which in turn involves the transportation of phosphorus products as the last stage before the use final use of the recovered phosphorus. It must be considered that the transportation of phosphorus products result in additional costs that can hinder the recycling of phosphorus, as well as environmental impacts related with the current use of fossil fuels-based transportation vehicles. In this context, coordinated-market approaches have been proposed to optimize the spatial distribution of phosphorus from regions with surplus of phosphorus to P-deficient locations, minimizing the cost and environmental footprint of the transportation of phosphorus products \citep{sampat2019coordinated}.

\section{Conclusions}
Phosphorus is a key non-renewable element for many economic sectors, and particularly for the production of food. The current linear economy scheme deplete phosphorus reserves, resulting in supply dependencies from regions holding phosphorus rock reserves, and it is the sources of nutrient pollution, eutrophication, and other environmental concerns relates with the end-of-life release of phosphorus into the environment. As a consequence, the recovery and recycling of phosphorus is not only a desirable but a necessary approach for the development of phosphorus sustainable systems. For achieving this goal, the mapping of phosphorus across the different economic sectors is the first stage to identify the main streams for phosphorus recovery. This information allows the estimation of the potential for the recycling of phosphorus in a region.

For the case of Ontario, the best case scenario result in a phosphorus recycling potential up to 86\% over the phosphorus imported in the province for food production (i.e., excluding the imports of livestock and food produced in other regions). An average phosphorus recovery cost is estimated, although it shows a large variation among different flows. Phosphorus recovery costs is particularly large for phosphorus recovery from manure due to the small scale of the livestock facilities in Ontario. Conversely, phosphorus recovery costs estimated for other regions with larger livestock facilities such as the U.S. Great Lakes area result in significantly lower values, showing the important role of the economizes of scale for phosphorus recovery. Nevertheless, considering the region studied as a whole, the average phosphosrus recovery cost estimated is around 36 EUR/kg P recovered, which is lower than the economic losses of phosphorus releases into the environment estimated at 74.5 EUR/kg of phosphorus.

The wide difference of costs for the recovery of phosphorus from different flows suggest the need develop regional cooperative mechanisms to distribute the phosphorus recovery costs. Moreover, further research in the effective distribution of the phosphorus recovered from regions with phosphorus surplus to phosphorus-deficient locations is needed, although there exist some research on the development of coordinated markets for phosphorus recovery and recycling.

%\subsection{Livestock census} \label{section:LivestockCensus}
%Livestock census is retrieved from the Census of Agriculture performed by Statistics Canada -- Statistique Canada every five years, i.e, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016, for cattle \citep{LivestockCensusCattle}, sheep \citep{LivestockCensusSheep}, swine \citep{LivestockCensusPig}, poultry \citep{LivestockCensusPoultry}, and other livestock \citep{LivestockCensusOtherLivestock}. The inventory of rabbits is not available prior 2009.
%
%Livestock census is reported using Dissemination Geography Unique Identifiers (DGUIDs). These identifiers are built based on 4 items combined in a unique DGUID identifier: vintage (4 digits representing the year of data collection), the type of geographic areas covered by the dataset (1 character code, A or S denoting administrative or statistical areas respectively), the schema (4 digits item denoting the kind of division considered. 0003 denotes Census Division), and the Geographic Unique Identifier (GEOUID) (variable alphanumeric code assigned to each individual geographical division), which in this case corresponds with the Census Divisions of Ontario identifier (a 4 digits code starting by `35') \citep{DGUID}. The GEOUID is extracted from the DGUID reported by the census using Pandas \citep{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010} to retrieve the number of animals of each type in each Census Division.
%
%\textcolor{red}{The inventory of animals for the years between two consecutive Census of Agriculture has been estimated through a linear interpolation between the data of consecutive census.}
%
%\subsection{Correction by animal production cycles} \label{section:CorrectionProductionCycles}
%The livestock census provides a snapshot of the number of animals in the region studied. We assumed that the number of animals reported is maintained constant along the year (i.e., the animals culled are replaces by new ones). However, in the case of broiler and turkey the number of animals reported by the livestock census have been reduced by a factor of 0.68 and 0.80 respectively, since these animals have life cycles of 43 and 80 days respectively, maintaining the barns empty for 20 days between cycles, as reported by \citet{yang2007development}.

%\subsection{P flows in manure}
%\subsubsection{Manure generation}
%Each type of animal has been in turn classified in different groups attending its different life stages as listed below. Moreover, a number of assumptions have been considered for the animal under evaluation to estimate the P released in the form of manure, which are listed below. The manure produced by elk, deer, and wild boar farming could not be accounted due to the lack of data regarding manure generation.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{Cattle:} Dairy cows, beef cows, beef calves, and dairy heifers are differentiated based on the data on manure generation and composition available.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Bulls and steers have been considered comparable to beef cows.
%		\item Calves have been considered beef calves.
%		\item Due to the lack of data for beef heifers and dairy heifers are merged as dairy heifers.

%	
%	\item \textbf{Swine:} Mature and immature animals are differentiated based on the data on manure generation and composition available.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Grower and finishing pigs, nursing pigs, and weaner pigs have been considered as immature pigs.
%		\item Sows and gilts for breeding, and boars have been considered as mature pigs.
%	\end{itemize}
%	
%	\item \textbf{Sheep:} Sheep and lambs are differentiated based on the data on manure generation and composition available.

%		\item Layer and broiler breeders (pullets and hens), and pullets under 19 weeks, intended for laying table eggs, are considered chicken pullets.
%		\item Laying hens, 19 weeks and over, that produce table eggs are considered chicken layers.
%	\end{itemize}
%
%		\item \textbf{Horses:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, all horses are considered as a single animal type. 
%	\begin{itemize}

%	\item \textbf{Llamas and alpacas:} Based on the data on manure generation and composition available, llamas and alpacas could be evaluated separately. However, the data reported by the livestock census aggregate these type of animals \citep{LivestockCensusOtherLivestock}.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item The average values for manure generation and composition of llamas and alpacas have been considered.

%\subsubsection{P flows in eggs}
%The production of eggs in Ontario has been retrieved at province level from \citet{EggOntario}. These data is available for the years 1998 to 2019. The data at provincial level is broken down at census level proportionally to the number of layer chickens in them reported by the Census of Agriculture \citep{LivestockCensusPoultry}, see section \ref{section:LivestockCensus} for more details.
%
%Since the egg is composed by white, yolk, and shield, all these elements must be accounted to compute the phosphorus contained in eggs. Since there is not a clear consensus in the literature regarding the phosphorus content of eggs, an average value of $173.35 \ \sfrac{\text{mg}}{100\text{g\textsubscript{egg}}}$ is assumed based on different works \citep{matt2009effect, rehault2019golden, bologa2013research}.

%\subsubsection{P flows in slaughter products} \label{section:PSlaughterProducts}
%Slaugthering facilities are part of the meat processing plants of Ontario. The data on slaugthering facilities in Ontario are retrieved from licensing permits reported by the goverment. However, it must be noted that meat plants licensing can be either federal or provincial \citep{RegulationMeatPlants}. Therefore, data from both kind of facilities must be accounted.
%%which data are separately reported. The deadstocks are reported at provicial level for both types of slaughtering plants. 
%
%\paragraph{Cattle} The number of cattle slaughtered in federal and provincial facilities in the province of Ontario is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected (Annual)' and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected (Annual)' sections respectively.
%
%\paragraph{Calves} The number of calves slaughtered in federal and provincial facilities in the province of Ontario is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected (Annual)' and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected (Annual)' sections respectively.
%
%\paragraph{Pigs} The number of total hogs slaughtered in Ontario (including both federally and provincially licensed facilities) is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat} by combining the 'Origin of hogs slaughtered – federally and provincially inspected', 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected (Annual)', and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected (Annual)' sections.
%
%\paragraph{Sheep and lambs} The number of sheep and lambs slaughtered in federally and Ontario (provincially) licensed plants is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Sheep and lamb slaughtered – federally inspected' and 'Cattle, veal cattle, hogs, sheep and lamb slaughtered – provincially inspected' sections respectively. However, for federally inspected facilities the data reported is aggregated for Ontario and the western provinces. The number of sheep and lambs slaughtered in federally inspected facilities is estimated from the ratio of animals culled in provincially licensed plants in Ontario to those in the western provinces for each year under evaluation.  
%
%\paragraph{Goats} The number of sheep and lambs slaughtered in federally and provincially licensed plants is retrieved from \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat}, 'Goats – federally and provincially inspected' section. Only data since 2014 is available.
%
%\paragraph{Chicken and turkeys} The total number of cattle slaughtered in Ontario (including both federally and provincially licensed facilities) is obtained from \citet{SlaughterFederalPoultry}.
%
%\paragraph{Rabbits} Only the number of rabbits culled in provincially inspected plants is reported \citep{SlaughterProvincialRabbits}.
%
%
%The live weight of each animal slaughtered $\left( W_{live} \right) $ is computed through the average warm carcass weight $\left( W_{carcass_{j}} \right) $ and the live to carcass weight ratio $\left(\eta_{\text{carcass to live}_{j}} \right) $, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:weightanimals}. The difference between the live and carcass weights are assumed to be slaughterhouse waste, Eq. \ref{eq:slaughterhousewaste}.

%\subsection{P flows in live animal imports and exports}
%Live animals imported and exported represent a significant flow of phosphorus entering and leaving the province of Ontario. Provincial imports and exports of cattle, hogs, and sheep are retrieved from \citet{CattleImportsExports,HogsImportsExports,SheepImportsExports} respectively. We note that data regarding the imports and exports of live poultry were not available, and data for the imports and exports of hogs are only reported since 2007. The imports of cattle and sheep are usually larger than the exports of these animals. Conversely, the exports of hogs are significantly larger than their imports in the region.
%
%The phosphorus flows within the animals involved in imports and exports operations are estimated based on the phosphorus contents reported in Table \ref{table:CarcassLiveWeightTatio}.
%
%\section{Comparison with previous studies}
%There exist previous studies mapping the phosphorus flows within the Canadian province of Ontario. Particularly, the work of \citet{BurrowsReport} performs an estimation of the phosphorus flows associated with the natural, industrial, municipal, and agricultural systems. However, a number of discrepancies have been found between this work and the report of \citet{BurrowsReport}, which are analyzed in the following sections. 
%
%\subsection{Livestock feed}
%The estimation of phosphorus contained in livestock feed is $\approx 5$ times larger in the study of \citet{BurrowsReport} than the results obtained in this work. This due to the discrepancy in  phosphorus intake of the different types of livestock, mainly in the P uptake of poultry. \citet{BurrowsReport} assume that poultry's feed is 1 kg per day of dry matter intake (DMI), conating 1-1.5\%. This result in a yearly phosphorus intake of 1.83-5.48 kg P. This value is significantly larger than the P intake for poultry considered in this studied, which are in the range 0.10-28 $\sfrac{\text{kg P}}{\text{year}}$ according to \citet{NetherlandsCompositions}. Although this study is performed in the Netherlands, the values provided are in agreement with the data reported for Canada by \citet{VanStaden2021}. However, the data reported by \citet{NetherlandsCompositions} is used in this work since more detailed data is provided.
%
%\subsection{Manure}
%\citet{BurrowsReport} and this study obtain estimation of phosphorus flows in manure within the same order of magnitude, although the result of the first study is approximately 2.5 times larger phosphorus in manure estimated in this work. We believe that the contributors to this discrepancy are the use of a unique value of manure production and composition for both sow and gilts assumed by \citet{BurrowsReport}, while we considered tailored values for each one of them, and secondly and mainly, their assumption of a unique and too large manure production value, 0.65 $\sfrac{\text{kg manure}}{\text{day}}$, for broilers, laying hens, pullets, and turkeys. This value seems too excessive for laying hens and broilers, which average weight in Canada in the year 2011 is reported to be 1.66 kg \citep{CanadaChickenWeight}. Attending to this, the assumption of laying hens and broilers produce manure for one third of their live weight on a daily basis seems unlikely to be reasonable. This reasoning can also be applied to the case of pullets. 
%
%\subsection{Agricultural products}
%\subsubsection{Milk}
%Significant discrepancies are found in the phosphorus flows associated with milk production between this study and the report performed by \citet{BurrowsReport}. The source of this disagreement is the data on milk production in Ontario in the year 2011. \citet{MilkOntario} report a milk production in Ontario for this year of $2,539 \cdot 10^{6}$ liters of milk, while the data provided by \citet{BurrowsReport} for the same year and province is $9.5 \cdot 10^{6}$ liters of milk
%
%\subsubsection{Eggs}
%A discrepancy of three orders of magnitude in the phosphorus outputs contained in eggs has been found. It is believed that this difference is due to the fact that \citet{BurrowsReport} report an egg production in Ontario for the year 2011 of 242,059 dozens of eggs in Ontario, while \citet{EggOntario} report that the production of eggs for the same spatio-temporal context of $242,059 \cdot 10^{3}$ dozens.
%
%\subsubsection{Slaughter products}
%Large discrepancies in the phosphorus contained in meat production and slaughterhouse waste is found between both reports. This can be due that in the work of \citet{BurrowsReport} is reported that 95,346, 365,868, 273,676 and 16,178,255 heads of bovine, porcine, ovine, and poultry animals were slaughtered in Ontario for the year 2011. These numbers are in general agreement with the data reported by \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat, SlaughterFederalPoultry} for provincially licensed facilities. However, according with \citet{SlaughterFederalRedMeat, SlaughterFederalPoultry}, a large number of animals are slaughtered in federally licensed in 2011 facilities located in Ontario, i.e., 610,485 and 4,086,081 heads of bovine and porcine animals, in addition to the ovine animals which data is reported aggragated for Ontario and the western provinces. These animals are estimated as described in Section \ref{section:PSlaughterProducts}. therefore, it is believed that the phosphorus flows reported by \citet{BurrowsReport} are estimated only for animals slaughtered in provincially licensed facilities, missing those flows originated in federally licensed facilities.
%
%\section{Field crop and vegetable sector}
%Phosphorus inputs associated with the grow of crops and vegetables are the result of fertilizer application to croplands, while the outputs include the phosphorus uptake by crops, and the phosphorus released into the environment, which can be retained in soil or transported by runoff and erosion, \textcolor{red}{as shown in Fig. ?}
%
%\subsection{Fertilizer application}
%\textcolor{red}{Add little intro}
%
%\subsubsection{Fertilizer applied to field crops} \label{section:FertilizerFieldCrops}
%Phosphorus applied as fertilizer to field crops of Ontario $\left( P_{fertilizer_{field}, Ontario} \right) $ is estimated based on the inputs of fertilizer products containing phosphorus at provincial level reported by \citet{FertilizerShipments}. Phosphorus applied to non-field crops, including greenhouse and nursery crops, is not accounted as phosphorus inputs to crop fields, so that the phosphate applied to greenhouse and nursery crops is subtracted from the total phosphate shipments. This correction is performed based on the total expenses on fertilizers in Ontario $\left(Cost_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario} \right)$, and for greenhouses and nursery crops $\left(Cost_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}, \ Ontario} \right)$ in Ontario \citep{FarmExpensesStatsCanada}, as the fertilizers expenditures for these crops are proportionally larger, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntario}. Average fertiliser expenditures between the years 2015-2020 are used. \textcolor{red}{This approach assumes that the phosphorus content of fertilizer used in the different crops is similar.}
%%This correction, based on the assumption that all fertilizers land receive the same amount of phosphorus, is performed by estimating the fraction of land devoted to greenhouses in relation to the total cropland area at census division level \citep{LandInputsStatsCanada, GreenhouseProductsStatsCanada}
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{field}, Ontario} = P_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario} \cdot \left(1- \frac{Cost_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}, \ Ontario}}{Cost_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario}}\right)  \label{eq:PFertilizerOntario}
%\end{align}
%
%%For census division $CD$, phosphorus inputs in the form of fertilizer applied to field crops $\left( P_{fertilizer_{field}, CD}\right) $
%The allocation of phosphorus applied to field crops to each census division $CD$ $\left( P_{fertilizer_{field}, CD}\right) $ is performed according to the fraction of fertilized area of each census division $\left(Area_{fertilized, CD} \right) $ over the total fertilized area in Ontario $\left(Area_{fertilized, Ontario} \right) $ \citep{LandInputsStatsCanada}, deducting the areas corresponding to non-field crops, i.e., greenhouses and nursery crops $\left( Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}\right) $ \citep{OntarioGreenhousesUsePerCDStatsCanada}, Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntarioCD}. The areas reported in the census of agriculture of 2016 are considered since the datasets reported includes data for all census divisions.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{field}, CD} = P_{fertilizer_{field}, Ontario} \cdot \frac{Area_{fertilized, CD} - Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, CD}}{Area_{fertilized, Ontario}-Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, Ontario}} \label{eq:PFertilizerOntarioCD}
%\end{align}
%
%%Fertilizer expenses of field crops, greenhouses, and nursery crops are retrieved from \citep{FarmExpensesStatsCanada}
%%\citep{OntarioLandUseOMAFRA, OntarioLandUseStatsCanada, OntarioGreenhousesUsePerCDStatsCanada}.
%
%\subsubsection{Fertilizer applied to non-field crops}
%Phosphorus applied to non-field crops as fertilizer in Ontario $\left( P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, Ontario} \right) $ is estimated as the product of the total phosphorus inputs in the form of fertilizers in Ontario and the fraction of fertilizer expenses for greenhouse and nursery crops over the total fertilizer expenditures in the province, similarly to Section \ref{section:FertilizerFieldCrops}, as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonField}.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, Ontario} = P_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario} \cdot \frac{Cost_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops}, \ Ontario}}{Cost_{fertilizer_{total}, \ Ontario}} \label{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonField}
%\end{align}
%
%The allocation of phosphorus applied to non-field crops to each census division $\left(P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, CD} \right) $ is performed according to the fraction of non-field crops area $\left( Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, CD} \right) $ over the total area of greenhouse and nursery crops in Ontario $\left(Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, Ontario} \right) $, Eq. \ref{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonFieldCD}, analogous to Section \ref{section:FertilizerFieldCrops}.
%
%\begin{align}
%	& P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, CD} = P_{fertilizer_{non\mbox{-}field}, Ontario} \cdot \frac{Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, CD}}{Area_{non\mbox{-}field \ crops, Ontario}} \label{eq:PFertilizerOntarioNonFieldCD}
