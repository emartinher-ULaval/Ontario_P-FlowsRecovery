  Description:
    Abstract:
      CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS_IDEM_IN.SHP contains 1,837 locations of all regulated animal confined feeding operations (CFO)
      in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ).
      IDEM personnel provided these upated data on October 19, 2018, as an Esri point shapefile named "IDEM_CFO.SHP."
      Attributes include farm size (CFO versus CAFO), site name, identification numbers (IDEM), address information,
      NPDES information, and number and types of animals handled.

      The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

      "This dataset consists of Confined Feeding Operations -  i.e. A swine, chicken, turkey, beef or dairy
      agri-business that has large enough numbers of animals that IDEM regulates for environmental concerns,
      as defined by IC 13-18-10 of the Indiana Code.

      "CFO - All regulated animal feeding operations in Indiana are considered 'confined feeding
      operations' (CFO). To be regulated under the 'Confined Feeding Control Law' in Indiana, you
      must meet the following size of any one livestock group listed below:

      "300 or more cattle

      "600 or more swine or sheep

      "30,000 or more poultry

      "5,000 horses in confinement

      "CAFO - The Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) designation is strictly a size designation
      in Indiana. Farms of this size are permitted under the CFO rule, but have a few added requirements
      under Indiana regulations. A CFO that meets the size classification as a CAFO is a farm that meets
      or exceeds an animal threshold number in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s definition of a
      large CAFO, which is:

      "700 mature dairy cows

      "1,000 veal calves

      "1,000 cattle other than mature dairy cows

      "2,500 swine above 55 pounds

      "10,000 swine less than 55 pounds

      "500 horses

      "10,000 sheep or lambs

      "55,000 turkeys

      "30,000 laying hens or broilers with a liquid manure handling system

      "125,000 broilers with a solid manure handling system

      "82,000 laying hens with a solid manure handling system

      "30,000 ducks with a solid manure handling system

      "5,000 ducks with a liquid manure handling system"

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      This data set was provided by IDEM personnel and is assumed to be accurate.

      The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

      "All attributes created during the data collection process were verified by visual inspection of
      the information in the database  with IDEM OLQ records to verify consistency. However, no formal
      tests were performed. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values
      in certain fields are either a result of changes made in the data dictionary used by the program or
      Section (adding or deleting attributes collected) as the project progressed, information was unknown
      or mistakenly left out, or the ommission was not relative to the method used to collect the data."

  Logical_Consistency_Report: This data set was provided by IDEM personnel and is assumed to be accurate.

  Completeness_Report:
    The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

    "This data set consists of locations of Confined Feeding Operations within the state of Indiana.
    This dataset is incomplete and a work in progress, as sites are GPS'd as they are inspected.
    This dataset contains information that represents what had been recorded, processed, and archived
    by IDEM personnel at a time previous to publication. However the data set may be incomplete and/or
    inaccurate due to the ever-changing status of managed facilities and sites, and due to the data
    collection and processing efforts of IDEM staff. It is an ever-changing work in progress. Data were
    collected by the Solid Waste Compliance section within the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department
    of Environmental Management. The Section was also responsible for collecting attribute information
    for each location. The data has been QA/QC'd for consistency but no formal tests were performed
    on accuracy. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values are due to
    the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as
    the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field with the ommission
    was not relative to the method used to collect the data.

    "Due to the mobility and short-life of many CFO operations, this data is unlikely to be complete. Staff
    has had difficulty determining locations for Out-Of-Business sites thay may have been inactive for a
    number of years. Secondly, if Operators efuse to report their business, it is difficult to be aware of
    their existence."

  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

        "The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system. The accuracy of the coordinates should be from
        1-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment (ie., multipath,
        SNR, and PDOP), and the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy cannot
        be guaranteed or verified. Each GPS unit should have been configured within the specifications of the
        manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field personnel would configure the unit outside of specifications
        if environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by logging both Maximum PDOP and the standard
        deviations of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value was > 6, the value
        for the "In_specs" field was input as "NO". If the standard deviation was > 8, the corrected GPS file was
        analyzed for signs of multipath and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the
        archive. If the data set was uneditable it was still left in the archive. The "In-specs" field was changed
        to "No" and the location could have an accuracy > 5 meters.

        "If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection
        as defined by the technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then
        the accuracy of the collected coordinates should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer
        Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5 meters (post-processed), the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters
        (post-processed), and the Pro XR has a range of .50 cm - 1m differential accuracy to real-time differential correction.

        "If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those
        given by the manufacturer."
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS:

        "The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less accurate than horizontal accuracy.
        The vertical accuracy for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error. However, this accuracy cannot be
        guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values have been recorded, but it is strongly suggested that the
        values not be used for any analysis.

        "Due to the nature of how these values are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large
        enough to make the coordinate values unuseable in any type of locational analysis."
