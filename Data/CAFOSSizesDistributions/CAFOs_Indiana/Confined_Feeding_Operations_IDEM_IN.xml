<abstract>
CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS_IDEM_IN.SHP contains 1,837 locations of all regulated animal confined feeding operations (CFO)
in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ).
IDEM personnel provided these upated data on October 19, 2018, as an Esri point shapefile named &quot;IDEM_CFO.SHP.&quot;
Attributes include farm size (CFO versus CAFO), site name, identification numbers (IDEM), address information,
NPDES information, and number and types of animals handled.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

&quot;This dataset consists of Confined Feeding Operations -  i.e. A swine, chicken, turkey, beef or dairy
agri-business that has large enough numbers of animals that IDEM regulates for environmental concerns,
as defined by IC 13-18-10 of the Indiana Code.

&quot;CFO - All regulated animal feeding operations in Indiana are considered &apos;confined feeding
operations&apos; (CFO). To be regulated under the &apos;Confined Feeding Control Law&apos; in Indiana, you
must meet the following size of any one livestock group listed below:

&quot;300 or more cattle

&quot;600 or more swine or sheep

&quot;30,000 or more poultry

&quot;5,000 horses in confinement

&quot;CAFO - The Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) designation is strictly a size designation
in Indiana. Farms of this size are permitted under the CFO rule, but have a few added requirements
under Indiana regulations. A CFO that meets the size classification as a CAFO is a farm that meets
or exceeds an animal threshold number in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s definition of a
large CAFO, which is:

&quot;700 mature dairy cows

&quot;1,000 veal calves

&quot;1,000 cattle other than mature dairy cows

&quot;2,500 swine above 55 pounds

&quot;10,000 swine less than 55 pounds

&quot;500 horses

&quot;10,000 sheep or lambs

&quot;55,000 turkeys

&quot;30,000 laying hens or broilers with a liquid manure handling system

&quot;125,000 broilers with a solid manure handling system

&quot;82,000 laying hens with a solid manure handling system

&quot;30,000 ducks with a solid manure handling system

&quot;5,000 ducks with a liquid manure handling system&quot;

This data set was provided by IDEM personnel and is assumed to be accurate.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

&quot;All attributes created during the data collection process were verified by visual inspection of
the information in the database  with IDEM OLQ records to verify consistency. However, no formal
tests were performed. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values
in certain fields are either a result of changes made in the data dictionary used by the program or
Section (adding or deleting attributes collected) as the project progressed, information was unknown
or mistakenly left out, or the ommission was not relative to the method used to collect the data.&quot;

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

&quot;This data set consists of locations of Confined Feeding Operations within the state of Indiana.
This dataset is incomplete and a work in progress, as sites are GPS&apos;d as they are inspected.
This dataset contains information that represents what had been recorded, processed, and archived
by IDEM personnel at a time previous to publication. However the data set may be incomplete and/or
inaccurate due to the ever-changing status of managed facilities and sites, and due to the data
collection and processing efforts of IDEM staff. It is an ever-changing work in progress. Data were
collected by the Solid Waste Compliance section within the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department
of Environmental Management. The Section was also responsible for collecting attribute information
for each location. The data has been QA/QC&apos;d for consistency but no formal tests were performed
on accuracy. Therefore accuracy cannot be guaranteed or verified. Omissions or null values are due to
the fact that edits were made in the data dictionary (adding or deleting attribute information) as
the project progressed, information was unknown or mistakenly left out, or the field with the ommission
was not relative to the method used to collect the data.

&quot;Due to the mobility and short-life of many CFO operations, this data is unlikely to be complete. Staff
has had difficulty determining locations for Out-Of-Business sites thay may have been inactive for a
number of years. Secondly, if Operators efuse to report their business, it is difficult to be aware of
their existence.&quot;

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile IDEM_CFO.SHP:

&quot;The data were collected with a GPS GIS-mapping system. The accuracy of the coordinates should be from
1-5 meters, depending upon the type of GPS instrument used, the collection environment (ie., multipath,
SNR, and PDOP), and the number of positions logged for each location. However, this accuracy cannot
be guaranteed or verified. Each GPS unit should have been configured within the specifications of the
manufacturer. However, if necessary, the field personnel would configure the unit outside of specifications
if environmental conditions warranted. Accuracy was checked by logging both Maximum PDOP and the standard
deviations of the positional average of each location collected. If maximum PDOP value was &gt; 6, the value
for the &quot;In_specs&quot; field was input as &quot;NO&quot;. If the standard deviation was &gt; 8, the corrected GPS file was
analyzed for signs of multipath and/or outliers, and edited accordingly. It was then re-exported to the
archive. If the data set was uneditable it was still left in the archive. The &quot;In-specs&quot; field was changed
to &quot;No&quot; and the location could have an accuracy &gt; 5 meters.

&quot;If the environmental conditions of the collection session fell within the acceptable ranges for data collection
as defined by the technical specifications of the instrument used and specific instrument configuration, then
the accuracy of the collected coordinates should be within those values as given by the manufacturer. The GeoExplorer
Unit has an accuracy range of 2 to 5 meters (post-processed), the GeoExplorer 3 and 3c a range of 1 to 5 meters
(post-processed), and the Pro XR has a range of .50 cm - 1m differential accuracy to real-time differential correction.

&quot;If the environmental conditions and/or technical configurations were not met, then the values could exceed those
given by the manufacturer.&quot;
</horizpar>
</horizpa>
<vertacc>
<vertaccr>
The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS:

&quot;The vertical accuracy for GPS data collection can be two to three times less accurate than horizontal accuracy.
The vertical accuracy for these locations could have up to 15 meters of error. However, this accuracy cannot be
guaranteed or verified. Height above Ellipsoid values have been recorded, but it is strongly suggested that the
values not be used for any analysis.

&quot;Due to the nature of how these values are derived in the GPS data collection process, the error variable is large
enough to make the coordinate values unuseable in any type of locational analysis.&quot;

IGS personnel received an updated Esri shapefile (and metadata) named CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS from IDEM
personnel (Shane Moore) on January 4, 2005. CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS was loaded into Esri ArcMap 9.0 and the
shapefile was visually checked to insure that all data points provided actually fell within the accepted IGS
state boundary. The shapefile was then edited by removing the following fields from the associated attribute
table: HORIZONTAL, NORTHING, EASTING, STANDARD_D, LOCATION_A, POSTAL_COD, and COUNTY_NAM.
IGS personnel then saved the edited shapefile as CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS_IDEM_IN to follow internal naming conventions.

IGWS personnel received an Esri point shapefile named &quot;IDEM_CFO.SHP&quot; from IDEM personnel (Miranda Hancock) on
October 19, 2018. IDEM_CFO.SHP was re-projected using ESRI ArcCatalog 10.6.0.8321 from geographic coordinates
(World WGS 1984) to projected coordinates (UTM Zone 16 NAD83), and then renamed &quot;CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS_IDEM_IN.SHP&quot;
to conform to internal naming conventions of the IGWS.

CONFINED_FEEDING_OPERATIONS_IDEM_IN.SHP was then loaded into Esri ArcMap, along with to the most recent version
of the previously published data (20150225). The layers were visually compared to record any significant changes to the
structure of the attribute table, fields, or values, as well as to the changes in the total number of records provided
(20150225 contained 3,437 locations, 20181019 contains 1,837 locations).

<edomv>CFO</edomv>
<edomvd>
All regulated animal feeding operations in Indiana are considered Confined Feeding
Operations (CFO). To be regulated under the Confined Feeding Control Law in Indiana, you must meet the following
size of any one livestock group listed; 300 or more cattle, 600 or more swine/sheep, 30,000 or more poultry, or 500 horses.

<edomv>CAFO</edomv>
<edomvd>
Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) designation is strictly a size
designation in Indiana. Farms of this size are permitted under the CFO rule, but have a few added requirements
under Indiana regulations. A CFO that meets the size classification as a CAFO is a farm that meets or exceeds
an animal threshold number provided by the U.S. EPA’s current definition of a large CAFO.
